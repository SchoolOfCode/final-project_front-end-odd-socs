Components is broken down into further folders where discrepancies are made between each type of component

Exclusive components are used only on one page and do not need to be re-used elsewhere
For example, components which make up the home page would be placed in the Home folder with a final component called 'HomePage' being exported to the index.js file and returned in the 'Home' component there

Examples of exclusive components:

- Home
- Navbar
- Login

Universal components are reusable components that are not unique to any one page.

Examples of universal components:

- Buttons
- Forms
- Containers

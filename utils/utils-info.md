Stores any utility functions
Utility functions generally need to be 'pure'functions, i.e. they always return the same thing
no matter what their input is

These tend to be simple functions with a dependable outcome, for example:

function add(num1, num2) {
return num1 + num2;
}

The function doesn't change any other value of code anywhere else and provides a simple output
